# Canonize
## Template for a “personal canon” website page.

Canonize is a simple, extensible framework for showcasing your “personal canon” — the most important, influential, formative texts and media in your life. It's intended to be added as a page to your personal website, to serve as a kind of library of highlights, a résumé of personal influences, a peek at the threads that have led to your work and way of thinking.

## To make your own “/canon” page:
- Make an awesome list of your canon items — see the “items” folder in this repo for an example of how I made mine (iteratively narrowing down from a massive list to a manageable one)
- Fork, clone, or otherwise appropriate the files from the “website” folder in this repo
- Edit the “index.html” page to include the items of your own canon, and optionally any category groupings you may want (each living inside the wrapper div with class="category" and id=“$YOUR-CATEGORY-SLUG”)
- Select one of the three included CSS “theme” files, and modify to your heart’s desire until your canon page looks hype as hell
- Add this page to your site using your preferred method of wrangling web files
- If, in the course of editing, you run into any bugs in these files, or have suggestions for improving them, feel free to submit a pull request
- When you’re done, I’d love to check out your canon! Feel free to contact me via https://www.brendanschlagel.com/

## Canon Themes:
I made three starter themes, each a simple CSS files you can use for your canon page: Light, Dark, and Manuscript. I actually started with the latter, to match the design on my current site, and more recently added the light / dark themes as a fun design exercise. You can use these as a rough starting point and modify as much or as little as you like. Here’s what each looks like:

### Example: Light Theme
