# canonize
Template for a “personal canon” website page.

Canonize is a simple, extensible framework for showcasing your “personal canon” — the most important, influential, formative texts and media in your life. It's intended to be added as a page to your personal website, to serve as a kind of library of highlights, a résumé of personal influences, a peek at the threads that have led to your work and way of thinking.
