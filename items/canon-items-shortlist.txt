Personal Canon — Shortlist
Last Updated: February 2016



### BOOKS [12]

His Dark Materials
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18116.His_Dark_Materials
Of the several fantasy series (Harry Potter; Redwall, Narnia) I read as a kid, this trilogy holds up best. Incredibly fun and inventive.

The Cuckoo's Egg
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98607.The_Cuckoo_s_Egg
An amazing true-crime hacker mystery; the first book that introduced me to the strange magic of computers and those who can manipulate them.

Moby-Dick; or, The Whale
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_The_Whale
An obvious classic I read only recently — it blew me away with its majestic language and vortex of ideas.

Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248193.Le_Ton_beau_de_Marot
Wonderful book by Doug Hofstadter about obsession with language and translation (and much more accessible than GEB).

Invisible Cities
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9809.Invisible_Cities
Both virtuosic creative writing and conceptual brilliance woven from short vignettes about imagined cities.

Autonauts of the Cosmoroute
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/971277.Autonauts_of_the_Cosmoroute
Hard to categorize, this memoir-cum-travelogue chronicles Cortazar's strange highway-bound road trip adventure.

One Hundred Years of Solitude
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude
My introduction to magical realism and Latin American literature; read at the end of high school, still a favorite.

Dune
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104.Dune
Recently renewed my appreciation for sci-fi and awed me with its super-cool worldbuilding.

Thinking in Systems: A Primer
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems
Clear and concise introduction to the power of systems thinking.

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland
I've found no other book as (relatively) old and short as this one that's as packed full with creativity; it takes big ideas and makes them at once fun and comprehensible — no mean feat!

The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704247-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin
It would be too easy to call Ben Franklin a genius; more importantly, he was a man who was good at not only thinking, but going from ideas to reality.

Impro
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/306940.Impro
Ostensibly about improvisational theater; but also actually about education, creativity, and much more from a very creative and perceptive teacher.

### IDEAS / WIKIPEDIA [16 - ?]

Autopoiesis
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis
“A system capable of reproducing and maintaining itself.” This idea of a self-contained, self-perpetuating system has fascinating implications for evolutionary and computational biology.

Biocentric universe
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocentric_universe
“Concept…which sees biology as the central driving science in the universe, and an understanding of the other sciences as reliant on a deeper understanding of biology.” A weird and unorthodox perspective, nonetheless interesting as a perspective-alteration device.

Bohm Dialogue
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohm_Dialogue
“Freely-flowing group conversation in which participants attempt to reach a common understanding, experiencing everyone's point of view fully, equally and nonjudgementally.” Interesting framework for productive group interactions — learning, communicating, problem-solving and more.

Dérive
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive
“An unplanned journey through a landscape, usually urban, on which the subtle aesthetic contours of the surrounding architecture and geography subconsciously direct the travellers, with the ultimate goal of encountering an entirely new and authentic experience.” One of my favorite activities!

  SEE ALSO: Psychogeography
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography
  “An approach to geography that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting" around urban environments; ‘…a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities…’”

Ekphrasis
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekphrasis
“A graphic, often dramatic, description of a visual work of art.” Interesting rhetorical device; calls to mind the work of Sol Lewitt and various transmedia experiments. Love the simple idea of evoking one type of thing via another.

Florilegium
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florilegium
“In medieval Latin…a compilation of excerpts from other writings…literally a gathering of flowers, or collection of fine extracts from the body of a larger work.” Evocative word holding some part of the interesting origins of collaged and compiled writing.

Froebel gifts
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froebel_gifts
“Play materials for young children designed by Friedrich Fröbel for the original Kindergarten at Bad Blankenburg.” Five simple gifts that blur the line between toys and educational objects.

Gaia hypothesis
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis
Idea ”that organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a self-regulating, complex system that helps to maintain the conditions for life on the planet.” Helpful new perspective on the world and our place it in.

Heterarchy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy
“A system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways.” Sort of the less annoying generalized idea behind something like holacracy. I love thinking about how abstract structures can be articulated and mapped out in useful ways.

Multimodality
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodality
“A theory of communication and social semiotics [that] describes communication practices in terms of the textual, aural, linguistic, spatial, and visual resources - or modes - used to compose messages.” Useful way of thinking about how we can design and create by combining different modes of communication.

‘Pataphysics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Pataphysics
“An absurdist, pseudo-scientific literary trope…that enigmatically resists being pinned down by a simple definition. One attempt at a definition might be to say that ‘pataphysics is…the science of imaginary solutions.” Hilariously perplexing and intriguing Oulipean philosophy!

  SEE ALSO: Oulipo
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo
  “A loose gathering of (mainly) French-speaking writers and mathematicians who seek to create works using constrained writing techniques.”

Quantum fiction
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fiction
“A literary genre that reflects modern experience of the material world and reality as influenced by quantum theory and new principles in quantum physics.” Strange new genre blending fantasy and sci-fi and scientific realism.

Rhizome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome
“In botany and dendrology…a modified subterranean stem of a plant that is usually found underground, often sending out roots and shoots from its nodes.” Interesting hidden connectedness of plant life!

Soundscape ecology
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology
“The study of sound within a landscape or seascape and its effect on organisms…[and] how…different sound sources interact across spatial scales and through time.” I love the idea of studying scientifically the effects of something largely invisible and relegated to the background.

Spime
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime
“A neologism for a futuristic object, characteristic to the Internet of Things, that can be tracked through space and time throughout its lifetime. They are essentially virtual master objects that can, at various times, have physical incarnations of themselves.” Blurring lines between single objects and their Platonic ideals; confounding ideas of manufacturing and persistence.

World-systems theory
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-systems_theory
“A multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to world history and social change [that] emphasizes the world-system (and not nation states) as the primary (but not exclusive) unit of social analysis.” Unusual way of thinking about the complex economic relationships that permeate the world.
