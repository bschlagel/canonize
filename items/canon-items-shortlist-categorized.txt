Last Updated: February 2016



### WORDS + LANGUAGE [8]
Rare words, sentences entangled and translated, prose wrought and wrangled, ridiculous rhymes.

Moby-Dick; or, The Whale [BOOK]

Eminem — The Eminem Show [ALBUM]
http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-eminem-show-mw0000140333
Not rap's, or even Eminem's best effort — but listening to this burned CD-R on repeat shaped my middle school rhyme-fiend aspirations.

Quantum fiction [IDEA]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fiction
“A literary genre that reflects modern experience of the material world and reality as influenced by quantum theory and new principles in quantum physics.” Strange new genre; sci-fi meets scientific realism.





### SCIENCE + TECHNOLOGY [9+]
Opening up a landscape of technical possibility; elucidating some of the complexities of the world.

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions [BOOK]
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland
I've found no other book as (relatively) old and short as this one that's as packed full with creativity; it takes big ideas and makes them at once fun and comprehensible — no mean feat!

Gaia hypothesis [IDEA]

Biocentric universe [IDEA]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocentric_universe
“Concept…which sees biology as the central driving science in the universe, and an understanding of the other sciences as reliant on a deeper understanding of biology.” A weird and unorthodox perspective, nonetheless interesting as a perspective-alteration device.

Soundscape ecology [IDEA]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology
“The study of sound within a landscape or seascape and its effect on organisms…[and] how…different sound sources interact across spatial scales and through time.” I love the idea of studying scientifically the effects of something largely invisible and relegated to the background.

Heterarchy [IDEA]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy
“A system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways.” Sort of the less annoying generalized idea behind something like holacracy.
